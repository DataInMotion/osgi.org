The OSGi Alliance is a worldwide consortium of technology innovators that advances a proven and mature process to create open specifications that enable the modular assembly of software built with Java technology. Modularity reduces software complexity; OSGi is the best model to modularize Java.

The OSGi technology facilitates the componentization of software modules and applications and assures remote management and interoperability of applications and services over a broad variety of devices. Building systems from in-house and off-the-shelf OSGi modules increases development productivity and makes them much easier to modify and evolve. The OSGi technology is delivered in many Fortune Global 100 company products and services and in diverse markets including enterprise, mobile, home, telematics and consumer.

The alliance provides specifications, reference implementations, test suites and certification to foster a valuable cross-industry ecosystem. Member companies collaborate within an egalitarian, equitable and transparent environment and promote adoption of OSGi technology through business benefits, user experiences and forums. The alliance also promotes collaboration among important ecosystem players within and outside the OSGi Alliance in order to provide the market with innovative solutions based on open standards.

Adoption of the component-based platform reduces time-to-market and development costs because it enables integration of pre-built and pre-tested modules. It reduces maintenance costs and provides aftermarket opportunities because networks are used to dynamically update or deliver services and applications in the field.

Member company industries include leading service and content providers, infrastructure/network operators, utilities, enterprise software vendors, software developers, gateway suppliers, consumer electronics/device suppliers (wired and wireless) and research institutions.

The OSGi Alliance is a non-profit corporation founded in March 1999.
